I'm a undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics](https://math.tju.edu.cn/), [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, image processing, machine learning, and AI for math. 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wang](https://math.tju.edu.cn/info/1715/6111.htm) from [[School of Mathematics](https://math.tju.edu.cn/), [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/).
